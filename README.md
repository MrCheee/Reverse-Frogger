<h2>Reggorf</h2>
1st Unity Game Project

<h4>Concept</h4>
Turn-based 2D tactical game where you control the flow of traffic to stop monsters from crossing the road

<h4>Game Story Summary</h4>
The judgement day has come. Monsters from the void have begun spawning into our world through magical portals. We have anticipated this coming and have planned our escape via a space ark that is currently docked at the space station. However, as the monsters appeared suddenly, we have to buy some precious time to board as many people as possible. Thankfully, there seem to be a restriction to the location of where the monsters can spawn in, and it lies one highway away from our space station. This is our last defense! The longer we keep the monsters away, the more lives we can save. Don't let the monsters cross that road!  
<h4>Game Flow Outline</h4>
Reggorf is a turn-based tactical game where the player controls the flow of traffic along the highway to get rid of the monsters crossing it. Monsters will spawn from the top sidewalk and begin to advance downwards towards the player. Vehicles will randomly spawn on the road and the player can adjust the speed of each lane to control how fast the vehicle moves within that lane. Killing monsters award skill points that can be used on player skills to directly influence the vehicles or monsters, such as sniping monsters, disabling units, boosting units for an extra turn, forcing a vehicle to change lane, calling in a vehicle to a lane, or air dropping a vehicle onto a specific spot on the highway. Each monster that makes it across the road will reduce the health of the player, and the game ends when playerâ€™s health reaches zero.
